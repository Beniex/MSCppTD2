Nowadays, communication between information systems is a challenge for most industrial firms. 
There are a lot of applications that require accessidence relationships. This comparison is based on the
terminological system BACK used as a helping too role (behavior) level, or term value domain level.
The semantic properties are added by means of a set of operators that we have defined. To find the
correspondence relationships between sets of implicit properties of two terms, we use an heuristic
[Larab and Benharkat, 1996] that we have defined to compute a value: "semantic measure". The semantic
measure helps us to find the right nature of semantic relationships that could exist between the semantic
property sets. The relationship between the semantic properties sets helps us to refine the correspondence
relationship between terms of different terminologies.

The transformation of existing heterogeneous and local databases to meet diverse groups of applications
or users need several global levels pere automatic extraction of such information. We will  present in
this paper a framework that produces factual correspondences, and then use them for the merging process.
Our aim is to minimize the administrator intervention. The system makes a proposal and the administrator
is asked to confirm or refuse.

This paper presents the CASE:COOPE an object oriented method aimed at information 


system design. This method is based on an event driven approach


and integrates at an early stage new 


technologies and models.


This CASE integrates COOPE models, formalisms and inherent controls.


The information system design is done via a Front End


and Back End tools based on a repository.


The CASE supports an incremental approach by means


of an interactive building of the repository.
